Parametric Analysis of Surface Roughness Value of Aluminium using Different Work Tool Combinations  
This experiment of end milling is carried out on VMC end milling machine equipped with maximum spindle
speed 8000rpm, three axes. The work material used was aluminium in the form of 50mm X 25mm X 10mm 
block. The machining parameter with considerably affect the surface roughness are identified as spindle 
speed (rpm), Feed (m/min), depth of cut (mm). The experiment was conducted using High Speed Steel (HSS) 
and Carbide cutting tool
